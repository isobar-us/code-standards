<section><h1 id="front-end-code-standards">Front-End Code Standards</h1>
<h2 id="general-introduction">General Introduction</h2>
<p>This document contains the guidelines and best practices for the front-end web development team at Isobar. </p>
<p>Each item here represents either:</p>
<ol>
<li>A reminder to follow existing standards or industry conventions,</li>
<li>Guidance on what constitutes professional patterns and organization, or </li>
<li>A decision we&#39;ve made favoring one method over its alternatives.</li>
</ol>
<p>What this document is <em>not</em> is a series of explanations as to how front-end technologies work; a basic familiarity is assumed. It also does <em>not</em> provide evaluations of the pros and cons of various alternatives; when appropriate we pick what we consider to be the best solutions and present them. Issues that don&#39;t yet have a clear solution are considered flexible and may or may not be listed.</p>
<aside class="box">
<p>It&#39;s recognized that the same conventions for all projects, clients, and teams isn&#39;t practical. For these reasons forks of this document are encouraged for various projects and teams.</p>
<p>What works well can be submitted and discussed as new recommendations moving forward.</p>
</aside>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p>Our motivations in creating this document are to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Foster code consistency across our projects </li>
<li>Facilitate ease of maintenance</li>
<li>Guide staff on-boarding or educate new developers</li>
<li>Ensure we create professional, robust, performant, and accessible websites</li>
</ol>
<p>This document is not intended to replace common sense, conventions requested by particular clients, teams, or prevent expressive or creative solutions to problems. Team or project-specific agreements or client requests will always supersede this document&#39;s content.</p>
<h4 id="professional-responsibility">Professional Responsibility</h4>
<p>We are experts in our field creating solutions for our clients and their target audiences, not for ourselves. Every technology and code choice needs to be measured against the potential benefits to the project objectives and  maintainability versus the <em>cool factor</em> or how <em>trendy</em> a particular solution may be. </p>
<p>Our industry is wrought with the flavor of the month, so please be deliberate. </p>
<p>Always remember that just because you <em>can</em> does not mean you <em>should</em>. Some solutions are not reliable, may not perform well, or may be difficult to maintain over time or add more code to. Always remember your code may not be the last added to a project in that particular feature area.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>At the outset of the project it is essential to properly understand the goals of the project and identify the specific deliverables expected of the front-end team. Where your responsibilities begin and end should not be taken for granted or assumed.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important to understand how the development environment will work, what tools will be available, and what the differences between development, test, and production environments may ultimately be.</p>
<p>Finally, all project teams should get a reasonable understanding of the what client&#39;s browser and device requirements are. Make no assumptions as to the technology available either from the client or their audience.</p>
<h4 id="pillars-of-front-end-development">Pillars of Front-end Development</h4>
<p>Whenever possible, the front-end technology solutions produced shall adhere to an industry best practice honoring as strict a separation of concerns as possible between:</p>
<ul>
<li>A semantic HyperText Markup Language (HTML) for structure</li>
<li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for presentation</li>
<li>JavaScript (JS) for behavior and interaction</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="general-standards">General Standards</h3>
<p>For any project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistency and conventions between team members is paramount</li>
<li>Solutions should be as simple and clear as possible, while serving a specific purpose</li>
<li>Clever does not necessarily mean good; readability is <em>critical</em></li>
</ul>
<p>A key hallmark of professional code includes a notion that while we are writing code that must reach a desired goal, we are also creating code that must be read and understood by others.</p>
<h4 id="code-consistency">Code Consistency</h4>
<p>Usage of the same patterns is critical between files, file types, and between team members so as to never deviate from expectations or cause confusion.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth establishing conventions at the project start or enabling automatic settings in the build or editor environments that might enforce particular rules.</p>
<h4 id="indentation">Indentation</h4>
<p>Please consistently indent, nest, include braces, quotes, and new lines so that code is clear and can be read easily. New code that is added should never deviate from existing formatting conventions or change the indent levels.</p>
<p>For all code languages, we recommend the use soft tabs comprised of four spaces per tab. Hitting the Tab key in your text editor should generate four space characters rather than one tab character. This results in our code appearing identical across platforms.</p>
<p>If tab stops are favored by a team, simply <em>maintain consistency</em> for a project and it&#39;s deliverables so developers can make adjustments to their editing environments a <em>single</em> time.</p>
<h4 id="readability">Readability</h4>
<p>We encourage liberal use of whitespace, comments, and descriptive variable names as appropriate for writing easy-to-read code. There is no need to write code in an obfuscated or compressed way for the purpose of file-size savings; we will use automated server-side or other build processes to concatenate, minify, and gzip all static client-side code (such as CSS and JavaScript).</p>
<h4 id="third-party-libraries">Third-Party Libraries</h4>
<p>Un-minified libraries and third-party scripts should be leveraged in local development environments for easier debugging if available. The code should be committed to source control in an unmodified state, or simply referenced in dependency management components that resolve the files in a build. The final products will be compressed with the rest of the source for delivery.</p>
<p>Likewise, third-party code and libraries should never be modified and their original source and the license must be documented and be appropriate for a project. Any changes to third party code must be agreed upon and must be for specific reasons. If changes are mandated by bug fixes then the appropriate upstream project should have the changes submitted (assuming the code is part of an open source repository).</p>
<p>Library code should be treated as an external dependency and should be considered something that may need to be wholesale updated or replaced at a later time.</p>
<p>Inclusion of any third-party code should be carefully considered and verified with the project team as the appropriate solution to a given problem. &quot;Adding another plug-in&quot; is not always the best solution. Finally, selection of third party libraries should be done carefully and not be out of alignment with the nature of the problem being addressed. </p>
<p>To be blunt, <em>use the right tool for the right job</em>.</p>
<h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>
<p>Quality deliverables are essential for professionals. Sloppy or messy deliverables are unprofessional and reflect poorly on the final product and the delivery team. Please remove legacy files, be certain the work is delivered in a clean file system, and in an orderly, logical structure that serves a clear purpose.</p>
</section>
<section><h2 id="html">HTML</h2>
<p>HTML markup defines the content of a document and gives it a rudimentary structure such as section dividers, headers, paragraphs, lists, menus, and forms.</p>
<h3 id="goals-for-markup">Goals for Markup</h3>
<p>Please follow conventions established for a given project so all team members can have the same expectations around document structure and markup.</p>
<p>Structural consistency is critical when talking about the types of pages being used on a site or in a Web app. The markup stucture provides all the necessary hooks for scripting and behavior, so it&#39;s important that the appropriate hooks are in place.</p>
<p>A clear, clean, and concise HTML structure is also necessary for semantics, flexibility, and a reliable deployment environment. Do <strong>not</strong> deviate from established templates or patterns without architect approval.</p>
<p>Which markup is used does matter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the most <em>meaningful</em> yet <em>minimal</em> markup required to present the styles and interaction required</li>
<li>Application-centric deliverables often have different types of requirements; please code accordingly </li>
<li>Maintain a clear separation of concerns, avoid inline styles and inline JavaScript whenever possible</li>
<li>Have reference implementations so that each team member knows what sorts of structures are appropriate, as well as where to add new code</li>
<li>Adhere to Web standards and avoid proprietary markup unless agreed upon</li>
<li>Build pages in such a way that blocks of code can be broken up and reused when implemented</li>
<li>Be sure front-end code is compatible with destination environments and delivery platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>The flexible nature of HTML markup and how losely browsers interpret markup sometimes lends itself to inconsistencies not always being discovered immediately. This belies the care necessary in crafting a document&#39;s structure and in following established patterns.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started-on-markup">Getting Started on Markup</h3>
<p>When crafting the HTML for a website, environment or technical constraints may impact the type of markup that can be used. Please discuss the final delivery environment in depth with technical leads and clients so that pages are not structured or styled in some way that is not effective for the project solution. </p>
<p>Discuss types of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Templates and types of pages</li>
<li>Which sections of pages are reused or managed by software vs. by hand</li>
<li>Frameworks, CSS grid systems (custom or otherwise)</li>
<li>Server-Side delivery platforms</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that it is vital to take into account how the site will ultimately be maintained and who will be doing that work.</em></p>
<h3 id="general-markup-standards">General Markup Standards</h3>
<p>As noted these guidelines are flexible for projects as long as consensus or need determines a particular path, consistency is what matters most.</p>
<p>Indent nested elements and tags with single indentation settings, whatever they may be, for each level in the hierarchy of the document.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsumLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo
        consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="semantic-markup">Semantic Markup</h4>
<p>HTML provides a number of semantic constructs that allow automated tools like search engines and screen readers to make sense of the document and to understand relationships between pieces of content. Use <em>semantic</em> markup whenever possible — that is to say use elements with specific meanings for specific purposes to convey the spirit of the markup. </p>
<p>A well-written HTML document will make appropriate use of these semantic elements and leave all responsibility for controlling the presentation of the document to the CSS stylesheet. </p>
<h4 id="validation">Validation</h4>
<p>Valid markup is a goal but not a mandate. Please have reasons for invalid markup if this is a concern. </p>
<h4 id="html-standards-and-browser-support">HTML Standards and Browser Support</h4>
<p>All markup will be written using the latest HTML5 markup specifications from the W3C, as implemented by browsers and devices that meet project requirements. When creating markup be sure that the target environments support the techniques being implemented, or that there is a fall-back plan.</p>
<p>Please use a common HTML5 polyfill or HTML5 Shiv to enable styling and recognition of HTML5 elements in older devices&#39; browsers.</p>
<h4 id="doctype">Doctype</h4>
<p>Always include a proper doctype to trigger standards mode. Omitting the doctype triggers quirks mode and should always be avoided. The HTML5 doctype is simple and easy to remember.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="character-encoding">Character Encoding</h4>
<p>All markup should be delivered as UTF-8, since it has the best support for internationalization. The character encoding should be designated in both the HTTP header and the head of the document via a meta tag. If the server happens to omit the HTTP header, browsers can take a guess at the character encoding and begins parsing and rendering the markup in a particular way. If there are inconsistencies, the browser will re-parse and re-render, throwing away all that work and starting over if it encounters the meta tag and its guess was incorrect. As a best practice, we always put the meta tag as early in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag as early as possible — however server-settings are ideal.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="optional-and-self-closing-tags">Optional and Self-closing Tags</h4>
<p>While current standards designate certain closing elements and even document level elements as optional, use all open and closing elements nested in the correct ways to ensure maximum compatibility and clarity of document structure. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, self-closing XML (i.e. XHTML, XML) style tags are not necessary.</p>
<h4 id="html5-elements">HTML5 Elements</h4>
<p>To provide additional semantic value to our documents, make use of HTML5 elements such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> where appropriate. However, in cases where the HTML needs to be as backwards-compatible as possible, do not apply IDs or classes to them, since older browsers do not understand these elements by default and will not apply styling to them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;header&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;site-header&quot;&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/header&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="attribute-values">Attribute Values</h4>
<p>Use quotes to surround all attribute values in HTML, despite quotes being optional in HTML5. This maintains consistency between attribute values that contain whitespace and those that don&#39;t.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;form class=&quot;registration module&quot; action=&quot;/register&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="ids-vs-classes">IDs vs. Classes</h4>
<p>HTML elements can be identified by using the <code>id</code> and <code>class</code> attributes. An ID is a unique identifier for that particular element; no other element on the page should use the same ID. This uniqueness allows <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> elements to associate themselves with a particular input and URLs to jump to a particular scroll position on a page. Classes are not unique. The same class can be used on multiple elements within a page, and a single element can have more than one class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;ul id=&quot;categories&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;category&quot;&gt;Jackets&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;category&quot;&gt;Accessories&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;category&quot;&gt;Shoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
<p>When coming up with names for an ID or class, we use semantic names like &quot;secondary-nav&quot; or &quot;primary-button&quot; that describe what the element is, rather than names like &quot;left-nav&quot; or &quot;blue-button&quot; that describe what the element looks like, which can change over time. We also use <em>lowercase names with hyphens</em> separating words as opposed to camelCase or underscores.</p>
<h4 id="anchors">Anchors</h4>
<p>All anchor links should point to absolute or relative URLs with user-readable content. Do not link to XML or JSON resources that are designed to be Ajaxed by JavaScript instead of navigated to directly, and do not put JavaScript in an anchor&#39;s <code>href</code> attribute like <code>javascript:loadPage(2);</code>. This allows search engines to index the content, allows the user to open the links in a new tab or window, and means the links will still work when JavaScript is broken, disabled, or not supported. This will require that the back-end be able to return a full HTML page for each important content state (e.g. sorting a table column).</p>
<h4 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h4>
<p>Avoid using <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags to separate paragraphs or lines of text. Use <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> instead with proper opening and closing elements.</p>
<h4 id="definition-lists">Definition Lists</h4>
<p>Use definition lists to display a single record of name-value pairs, like a contact card.</p>
<h4 id="tables">Tables</h4>
<p>Tables should not be used for page layout; only use them when you need to display tabular data. Tables provide an important semantic association (used mostly by screen readers for the sight-impaired) between row/column headers and their data, so use <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> rather than other elements when displaying multiple records of data.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> element is the recommended way to describe a table for both sighted and sight-impaired users, though this can also be done less semantically in the normal page text around the table. Use the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> elements to denote which row contains column headers so when a user prints the website and the table runs onto another page, browsers can display the <code>&lt;thead&gt;</code> on each page for easier readability. Remember to use the <code>scope</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> element to indicate whether the header applies to the row or column.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;caption&gt;First two U.S. presidents&lt;/caption&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Took office&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Party&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;George Washington&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;April 30, 1789&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;n/a&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;John Adams&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;March 4, 1797&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Federalist&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="forms">Forms</h4>
<p>For both semantic and functional reasons, we make full use of the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag for all sections requiring user input. All form <code>action</code> attributes should point to URLs with user-readable content, so they will still work if the form is submitted by the user before JavaScript has loaded on a page, or if JavaScript is broken, disabled, or not supported. This will require that the back-end be able to return a full HTML page for form submission (e.g. registering a new user, editing the quantity in a shopping cart).</p>
<p>Do not nest HTML form elements.</p>
<h4 id="input-labels">Input Labels</h4>
<p>All input fields should be associated with a <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element. The <code>for</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element should contain the ID of the corresponding input field. This means the input field will receive focus when a user clicks the label and also enables screen readers for sight-impaired users to read out an appropriate description of the input field.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;label for=&quot;home-address&quot;&gt;Home Address&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input id=&quot;home-address&quot; type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<h3 id="markup-deliverables">Markup Deliverables</h3>
<p>Typically HTML deliverables are incorporated into Content Management Systems or application delivery platforms as templates. A plan for incorporation of templates that leverage patterns created during the markup creation phase should be followed and matching types of pages to templates that were created, so that an association between the source markup and the destination markup can be maintained over time.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps-amp-html5-resources">Next Steps &amp; HTML5 Resources</h3>
<p>Considerations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Site maintenance procedures</li>
<li>Browser testing strategies</li>
<li>How new features will be added</li>
<li>Where new features will be added</li>
<li>What the file system looks like for static site assets</li>
<li>If a CDN is involved</li>
<li>Naming conventions and organization of graphics and photography assets</li>

</section>
<section><h2 id="css">CSS</h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is where the visual presentation and design rules for a website belong. Well-written CSS makes good use of its cascading nature - general styles are applied first, and those styles are overridden for more specific instances as necessary.</p>
<h3 id="goals-for-effective-css">Goals for Effective CSS</h3>
<p>CSS is an unusual language which can easily lead to code bloat, inconsistencies in design or clashing code techniques. It is easy to end up with CSS code that is so fragile it can cause site-wide regressions with small changes.</p>
<p>CSS should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be easy to maintain.</li>
<li>Follow clear enough patterns to understand.</li>
<li>Offer a clear place for new styles going forwards.</li>
<li>Not be a drag on page loading performance.</li>
<li>Not include unused style rules.</li>
<li>Address different devices, browser versions, and do as much as it can with as little code as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>When setting up the CSS for a site, always consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the default styles for HTML elements are going to be.</li>
<li>Which styles are global styles versus specific one-off use-cases.</li>
<li>Distinctions between code for layout and for content.</li>
<li>How the code will evole and grow.</li>
<li>Potential impact of bug fixes on the overall site.</li>
<li>Use of images as CSS background images vs. inline HTML (content).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getting-started-with-css">Getting Started with CSS</h3>
<p>Planning for a CSS build isn&#39;t that different than any other software requirements for Web development. A solid foundation starting point is critcal.</p>
<p>Before coding, you should always:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the design.</li>
<li>Plan around technical constraints.</li>
<li>Identify how content will be managed.</li>
<li>Be certain who will be able to modify the design directly via code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to segment code in logical ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate page grids and containers from the content.</li>
<li>Create baseline components which may be extended by other styles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Baseline components should rarely be modified directly.</p>
<p>More specifically, you may have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core brand styles.</li>
<li>Basic typography or default HTML rules.</li>
<li>Site-wide styles.</li>
<li>Distinct sections of the site.</li>
<li>Micro-sites and landing pages.</li>
<li>Components, widgets, or re-usable modules.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>
<p>Sometimes a third party library helpful — but please be certain to not include extra code for no reason other than personal enjoyment. Libraries or tools should be picked based on the advantages they provide.</p>
<p>Common types CSS-related tools might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>File concatentation</li>
<li>Precompilers</li>
<li>Minifiers</li>
<li>Post processors</li>
</ul>
<p>These should be considered in the context of the rest of the site construction, back-end, and continuous integration processes. Discuss the options with the technical lead on the project.</p>
<p>Be careful as these tools can also introduce unnecessary complexity unless used wisely.</p>
<h4 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h4>
<p>Pre-built UI components or CSS frameworks can be beneficial, however just like any third party code please choose wisely and based on benefit of features and flexibility. Locking development into a library that unintentionally imposes limits is not good.</p>
<p>Some examples of third party frameworks might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI component or widget libraries (e.g. Foundation, Bootstrap, jQuery UI)</li>
<li>Grid Systems</li>
<li>Typography adjustments</li>
<li>Normalizing code </li>
</ul>
<aside class="box">
<p>External libraries should always be assessed for the pros/cons and potential benefits, vs. the barrier to entry and level of effort involved in their usage. </p>
<p>For instance, a grid system may not match the grids in the design, and it may not be adjustable enough for a given design.</p>
</aside>

<h4 id="establishing-conventions-and-development-strategies">Establishing Conventions and Development Strategies</h4>
<p>Like other aspects of the code on a site, consistency is key. Areas of critical consistency might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coding techniques</li>
<li>Naming conventions</li>
<li>File and folder structure</li>
<li>Examples or sample code</li>
</ul>
<p>On a large site never develop using a single CSS style sheet, though a single file served for a page is best. To this end we often recommend the use of CSS preprocessors to break stylesheets into smaller, better organized files, or the use of a build process to combine files for serving via HTTP.</p>
<h5 id="living-style-guides-and-reference-implementations">Living Style Guides and Reference Implementations</h5>
<p>One technique to consider is maintaining static HTML style reference implementations well into integration with server-side / back-end systems. These could be a series of templates or widgets that use the live styles being built. This helps reduce regressions that can happen across the board as the code for the site evolves. Continue to test these reference implementations as they will be the &quot;source of record&quot; for the styles created on the site. They also allow you to more easily distinguish the front-end bugs from the bugs potentially intriduced by integration with a complex back-end.</p>
<p>These refernece implementations can serve as a <em>living style guide</em> and broken components are easily spotted in testing over time.</p>
<p>Defining a solid style guide to be applied to tag names can significantly reduce the size of the CSS if that styleguide is adhered to by both the design and development teams. It is recommended that a styleguide is agreed upon at the beginning of a project, defined in HTML and then iterated on by both the design and development teams.</p>
<h3 id="general-css-standards">General CSS Standards</h3>
<p>What follows are some basic concepts for standardization of CSS code. Naturally, feel free to fork, update per project, and even issue pull requests for further discussion based upon experience.</p>
<h4 id="inclusion">Inclusion</h4>
<p>Use the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag to include all your stylesheets in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the document. For optimal page performance, concatenate your CSS into as few files as possible and do not use the <code>@import</code> command to include other stylesheets, as this will fire an additional HTTP request and block page rendering until its completion.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;main.css&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="formatting-css">Formatting CSS</h4>
<p>Basic rules for formatting CSS files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a new line for every selector and every declaration.</li>
<li>Use a single space before the opening brace in a set of rules.</li>
<li>Use lowercase for elemnts and shorthand hex values, e.g., <code>#aaa</code>.</li>
<li>Hyphenate class selector names; avoid underscores and camelCase </li>
<li>Quote attribute values in selectors</li>
<li>Use one level of indentation for each declaration.</li>
<li>The closing brace of declaration goes in the same column as the first character of the set of rules.</li>
<li>Use a single blank line between sets of rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside sets of rules or style declarations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a single space between the property and value, for example:<br>
<code>prop: value;</code> and <em>not</em> <code>prop:value;</code>.</li>
<li>Use double quotes for quoted values</li>
<li>Always include a semi-colon at the end of the last declaration.</li>
<li>Use shorthand if you can, like:<br>
 <code>padding: 15px 0;</code> and <em>not</em> <code>padding: 15px 0px 15px 0px;</code></li>
<li>When allowed, use <code>0</code> without units.</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting each selector on its own line and each property on its own line is great for readability and so version control systems can clearly show which parts have changed in a diff.</p>
<p>The attributes within a selector can be alphabetized for easy scanning and so that compression algorithms like gzip have a greater chance of finding repeatable patterns.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<!-- do we want more examples to cover most of the notes above? -->

<pre><code class="language-css"><span class="class">.content</span> <span class="rules">{
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">margin-left</span>:<span class="value"> -<span class="number">2</span>%</span></span>;
<span class="rule">}</span></span>

<span class="class">.twitter-popular</span>,
<span class="class">.twitter-favorites</span>,
<span class="class">.twitter-feed</span> <span class="rules">{
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">float</span>:<span class="value"> left</span></span>;
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">padding-left</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="number">2</span>%</span></span>;
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">width</span>:<span class="value"> <span class="number">33.33</span>%</span></span>;
<span class="rule">}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Do not indent child styles underneath their parent styles; this is important for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We usually recommend indenting media queries, so this can cause confusion.</li>
<li>Some CSS preprocessors heavily use indentation.</li>
<li>Various levels of indentation hinders maintainability. </li>
<li>HTML and CSS structure can change frequently over the course of a project, quickly rendering obsolete the parent-child relationship the indentation used to represent.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="specificity">Specificity</h4>
<p>Use the minimum specificity required to acheive the desired style. It can be difficult to quickly read and locate styles or even bugs with heavily nested styles in the CSS.</p>
<p>The ID is the most specific selector, since it can only match one element, and the class is a close second. Use those whenever possible rather than HTML tag names. </p>
<pre><code class="language-css">/* BAD */
button#back-button { ... }
.popular ul li a { ... }
.popular &gt; ul &gt; li &gt; a { ... }

/* GOOD */
.back-button { ... }
.popular-link { ... }
.unpopular-link { ... }</code></pre>
<p>As a rule, CSS is most maintainable with the simplest selectors possible. Try applying a class to the element you want to target instead.</p>
<aside class="box">
<p>While performance of CSS selectors has been a debated topic, browsers perform quite well on most types of selectors. That said, specificity reduced to the most simple name to get the desired results is the best idea in most cases <strong>for readabilty</strong> and <strong>maintainabilty</strong>.</p>
</aside>

<h5 id="do-not-use-important">Do Not Use !important</h5>
<p>Avoid using the <code>!important</code> keyword. Treat it like the nuclear option, only to be used in the most extreme of cases. This fundamentally destroys the specificity feature and can even break accessibility for some users.</p>
<p>There is usually another way to achieve the same goal without causing headaches for developers in the future who are either trying to debug a styling issue, or trying to use normal specificity to override a style for a particular element only to find that they can&#39;t.</p>
<h4 id="id-selectors">ID Selectors</h4>
<p>As noted above, use the lowest level of specificity necessary to get the desired results. This means the use of the ID selector should be minimized. Often creating a new class is preferable to using inheritance or additional specificity to target an element or elements. </p>
<p>ID selectors, if used, should be used mainly as access points for JavaScript or if a very particular use case surfaces. Styles and classes can be applied via the same element with a className.</p>
<h4 id="vendor-prefixes">Vendor Prefixes</h4>
<p>When using vendor prefixed features, put the standardized rule at the end to ensure browsers optimize and use the standard if they recognize it. </p>
<p>For example: </p>
<pre><code class="language-css"><span class="class">.thing</span> <span class="rules">{
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">-webkit-transition</span>:<span class="value"> all <span class="number">100</span>ms</span></span>;
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">transition</span>:<span class="value"> all <span class="number">100</span>ms</span></span>;
<span class="rule">}</span></span></code></pre>
<h4 id="inline-styling">Inline Styling</h4>
<p>Do not hard code style information into your HTML markup directly, either with the <code>style</code> attribute that accepts CSS or with deprecated attributes such as <code>align</code>, <code>border</code>, or <code>width</code>. These are difficult to maintain and make it harder to track down what is causing an element to appear as it does.</p>
<h5 id="performance-caveats">Performance Caveats</h5>
<p>In some cases for performance reasons it may be good practice to inline critical styles in a <code>style</code> block in the document&#39;s <code>head</code>. This delivers these styles to the browser in the fastest method possible by preventing the need for an additional HTTP request. Fetching linked style sheets are a blocking operation on the rendering of a Web page in a browser in most cases. An enormous CSS file can mean a highly reduced time to first rendering because a browser may pause during loading of the page to download CSS which may not even be used on the first page. </p>
<p>With the above in mind it may be desirable to include the rules required to render the top portions of a page (i.e. &quot;Above the fold&quot;) in advance of styles loaded after the rendering begins. Critical styles can be identified either manually or through the use of a tool. Non critical styles can then be asynchronously loaded, increasing the perceived page load speed.</p>
<h4 id="box-model">Box Model</h4>
<p>To simplify CSS authoring, we set the <code>box-sizing</code> attribute to <code>border-box</code> for all page elements. This enables us to use round numbers for width like 50% and then apply a padding or border to that same element without needing to</p>
<ol>
<li>adjust the width accordingly using calc (since borders use pixels rather than percents) or</li>
<li>create an element inside it to take the padding and border. This is the only case where we use the inefficient universal selector (<code>*</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">* <span class="rules">{
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">-moz-box-sizing</span>:<span class="value"> border-box</span></span>;
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">-webkit-box-sizing</span>:<span class="value"> border-box</span></span>;
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">box-sizing</span>:<span class="value"> border-box</span></span>;
<span class="rule">}</span></span></code></pre>
<h4 id="coding-patterns">Coding Patterns</h4>
<p>There are a number of popular design patterns for naming conventions on selectors, groupings or extentions of styles in CSS files. Sometimes these are of value and may be used on projects as long as the developers are on board and they are used consistently by the team. </p>
<aside class="box">
<p>Examples of pattern systems include BEM, SMACSS, Object Oriented CSS, Atomic design, and others.</p>
</aside>

<!-- links? -->

<p>The downsides to some of these systems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Often rely on less obvious rules that may be difficult to follow.</li>
<li>They may use syntax that may be objectionable to some developers.</li>
<li>Some developers may find the syntax difficult to read.</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons it is often best to go with the most simple, basic set of conventions possible, based on obvious patterns.</p>
<h4 id="a-simple-css-code-pattern">A Simple CSS Code Pattern</h4>
<!-- Isobar Component Pattern 
    This entire section might be best left out, I don't know if it goes 
    too far for the document? From there down to "Utilities"
-->

<p>The following sections describe one simple approach, and as long as the types are defined on a project and the patterns are followed, then a clear meaning can be interpreted fairly quickly and easily reading through the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Every site will have distinct requirements but some examples of things that can be standardized on a site build include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global Defaults</li>
<li>Page Level Rules (grids, site template types, and so on)</li>
<li>Components</li>
<li>Modifiers</li>
<li>State</li>
<li>JavaScript-only Rules</li>
<li>Utilities</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections describe how some might work.</p>
<h5 id="global-defaults">Global Defaults</h5>
<p>For the purposes of discussion we could refer to the global defaults as the baseline HTML elements and their associated styles. Frequently you may wish to use a third party library which normalizes CSS behavior accross browsers. Either way, it makes sense to keep these files in their own files.</p>
<h5 id="page-level-rules">Page Level Rules</h5>
<!-- need more content here -->

<p>Any site is liable to have a standard baseline set of grids and types of pages. These grids can be collected into their own distinct set of component files — using a broad definition of a global &quot;thing&quot; as a component.</p>
<h5 id="components">Components</h5>
<p>Components are a high level concept for organizing CSS files and rules. A component simply means a grouped set of rules pertaining to an object or set of related objects on a page.</p>
<p>Additionally, encapsulating these components into distinct files is a great option. Within this file, using a naming convention is a tremendous help here for code maintainability and readability. </p>
<p>Group styles under a simple namespace using a <strong>prefix-suffix-modifier</strong> type pattern such as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">/* core component */
.component { ... }

/* component elements */
.component-header { ... }
.component-content { ... }

/* component descendant */
.component-content-group { ... }

/* component descendant element */
.component-content-group-header { ... }
.component-content-group-imgs { ... }</code></pre>
<p>This type of pattern is easy to read, extend, and follow in the absence of something more sophisticated.</p>
<p>Addionally, generally components will be the only CSS class with distinct names that do not have prefixes before the core, root, or base name of the component (e.g. above we are usin <code>component</code>).</p>
<p>Just to get developers thinking, these might be things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>navbar</li>
<li>footer</li>
<li>page-info</li>
<li>article-date</li>
<li>lead</li>
<li>widgetfoo</li>
<li>byline</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="modifiers">Modifiers</h5>
<p>If you need to extend an existing component then create distinct modifier classes with the prefix <code>mod-</code> to easily indicate that it is a modifier and not a complete style. Using the <code>mod</code> name prefix prevents confusing the class with a full class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.mod-modifier-a { ... }
.mod-modifier-b { ... }</code></pre>
<p>Then, when used in the HTML, the class stands out:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;div class=&quot;component-content mod-modifier-a&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This is a strong technique because the modifier classes can stand on their own in the CSS. Further, they may also be altered via more complex rules:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.component-header.mod-modifier-a { ... }</code></pre>
<p>This is simplistic and easy to follow, understand, and expand upon.</p>
<h5 id="state">State</h5>
<p>A <em>state</em> for an element or component is presentation information for a given component. This may be a dynamic state set by JavaScript or a user interaction, but not always. It could also be a preset from the server or the results after a transaction. State modifiers are a great way for a distinct class to be provided to engineers unfamilar with the design to be provided hooks for various things. This is slightly different than JS specific classes, however.</p>
<p>State rules will use the <code>is-</code> prefix.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.component-group.is-full { ... } 
.component-group.is-expired { ... }</code></pre>
<p>Treating components&#39; <em>state</em> as a modifier that is boolean (i.e. <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>) also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semanticallly helps provide information about the content.</li>
<li>Separates the code for state from default presentation.</li>
<li>Removes the need to update corresponding states or components if the name of either changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last point is important from a maintenance perspective.</p>
<p>It&#39;s best to try to restrict these state indicators as being restricted to a specific component.</p>
<h5 id="javascript-js-prefix">JavaScript (JS) Prefix</h5>
<p>The usage of a <code>js-</code> prefix is present in the markup but should never really appear in the CSS file itself. If the styles are being set, then use modifiers or state type classes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;button class=&quot;component-button js-execute&quot;&gt;...&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>js-execute</code> rule should not appear in the CSS file, but only in JS files they are tied to behavior. These are events, verbs, or action related, and are access points for JavaScript not a toggle or state changer. It&#39;s best to think of these classes as closer to and ID attribute in the html.</p>
<h5 id="utilities">Utilities</h5>
<p>A utility is a type of component modifier that is specifically designed to be used on more than one component type. If it was restricted to a single component, it would simply be a modifier.</p>
<p>Utilities will use the prefix of <code>u-</code> and should serve only the modifier purpose intended without side effects when applied to any component, or component decendant.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css"><span class="class">.u-warning</span> <span class="rules">{

<span class="rule">}</span></span>
<span class="class">.u-scroll-infobox</span> <span class="rules">{
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">overflow-x</span>:<span class="value"> scroll</span></span>;
    <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">width</span>:<span class="value"> auto</span></span>;
<span class="rule">}</span></span></code></pre>

<h3 id="css-deliverables">CSS Deliverables</h3>
<p>Please be aware of potential conflicts between the original development environment for CSS and an ultimate deployment to production systems, if continuous integration will allow the continued use of CSS preprocessors, or if there should a cross-platform development strategy.</p>
<p>Delivered CSS should be concatenated, minified, tested against browser bugs (e.g. MSIE selector count bugs) and extra files should be removed.</p>

<section><h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript is where extra behaviors, features, and functionality not offered natively by Web browsers through CSS and HTML is created. </p>
<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p>JavaScript should be used sparingly, and when a deliberate choice is made to not perform a task on the server or by another means. </p>
<p>Any and all JavaScript code that&#39;s added to a Web page should be there <em>if and only if</em> it is needed for the page to achieve the desired ends or if there aren&#39;t any negative impacts with it there.</p>
<p>Included JavaScript should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be included after careful consideration.</li>
<li>Have the performance overhead and file size evaluated.</li>
<li>Have a feature set that is understood and appropriate.</li>
<li>Perform only the necessary tasks without needless overhead.</li>
<li>Have maintainability carefully assessed.</li>
</ul>
<p>While being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast, efficient, and perform well.</li>
<li>Re-usable if possible.</li>
<li>Not conflict with other code on a given page or sets of pages.</li>
<li>Executed only when necessary on a given page or sets of pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise, the absense of the code should be carefully considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens if for some reason this code is missing or does not run? </li>
<li>What happens if the code triggers an error?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>Client buy-in may be necessary for the usage of JavaScript for some features. It may be a forgone conclusion but usage of libraries or custom code should be discussed with the team and client technical leads to be certain the teams are on the same page.</p>
<p>A JavaScript developer should be thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is code that does this task already?</li>
<li>Code formatting rules, naming conventions, file locations, etc.</li>
<li>Testing the code on various browsers and devices.</li>
<li>If <code>strings</code> of text should be external for content management or translation.</li>
<li>If code being added might be useful outside of the current problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>All too often a developer will solve a problem in a closed context and not consider the whole picture. It is well worth considering if parts or all of the code being added can be useful elsewhere. Centralized code is excellent because it can be updated once and re-used everywhere.</p>
<p>Examples of possible things to centralize:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI controls (e.g. spinners, modals, tabs, etc.)</li>
<li>Date handling utilities</li>
<li>Query string parsing utilities</li>
<li>Ajax, validation, or other libraries</li>
<li>Tests for global conditions (e.g. window size, feature support, etc.)</li>
<li>Settings and configuration options (e.g. paths to services, debug flags, duration settings, minimum or maximum values, etc.)</li>
<li>Page, window, or document level events (e.g. Ajax, resize, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line, please understand what the JavaScript does and how it does it if you are including third party code.</p>
<h4 id="javascript-libraries-frameworks-and-plugins">JavaScript Libraries, Frameworks, and Plugins</h4>
<p>These days it is common for complex libraries and frameworks to be used on sites, especially when the client-side is become more and more responsible for larger parts of applications and Web sites.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Libraries</strong> are code you use within your structure and organizational patterns, featuring code that is available to you and you call upon.</li>
<li><strong>Frameworks</strong> are code structures that serve specific purposes and call your code for specific goals. </li>
</ul>
<p>The basic idea is an &quot;inversion of control&quot; in the code. This is debatable, but something like jQuery could be said to be a library, while Angular, React, or Backbone would be a framework.</p>
<p>Either way, these are <em>third party code</em> that should be carefully considered when it is determined to be included in a project or not.</p>
<h5 id="selection-of-third-party-code">Selection of Third Party Code</h5>
<ul>
<li>Technical Requirements</li>
<li>Quality and maturity of code</li>
<li>Future support</li>
<li>Staff skill sets</li>
<li>How tightly coupled to the layers of the application the code may be</li>
<li>Open source community activity</li>
<li>Be tested against various devices and platform requirements</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="code-architecture">Code Architecture</h4>
<h3 id="javascript-standards">JavaScript Standards</h3>
<h4 id="inclusion">Inclusion</h4>
<p>Use the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to include your JavaScript files at the bottom of your HTML document just before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag. For optimal page performance, concatenate your JavaScript into as few files as possible.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;script src=&quot;main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<h4 id="formatting">Formatting</h4>
<p>The use of whitespace should follow long-standing English writing conventions. </p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each comma and colon (and semi-colons that don&#39;t end a line) should be followed by a single space.</li>
<li>Binary and ternary operators should have a single space on each side.</li>
<li>There should be no space characters between parentheses and their contents.</li>
<li>Opening braces should appear on the same line as their preceding argument.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>, len = arr.length; i &lt; len; i++) {
    <span class="comment">// do something</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>To maximize readability without worrying about which boolean operators bind more tightly than others, each segment of a boolean expression should be enclosed in parentheses.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="keyword">if</span> ((allowUpdate) &amp;&amp; ((user.isAdmin) || (user.role === item.owner))) {
    <span class="comment">// do something</span>
}</code></pre>
<h4 id="variable-declaration">Variable Declaration</h4>
<p>To avoid confusion between global and local variables, we declare each variable on its own line with the <code>var</code> keyword. We do not use a single <code>var</code> keyword and then chain several variable declarations onto it separated by a comma.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="keyword">var</span> width;
<span class="keyword">var</span> height;
<span class="keyword">var</span> newObject = {};
<span class="keyword">var</span> newArray = [];
<span class="keyword">var</span> $body = $(<span class="string">'body'</span>);
<span class="keyword">var</span> currentVal = $(<span class="keyword">this</span>).val();
<span class="keyword">var</span> min = parseInt($(<span class="keyword">this</span>).attr(<span class="string">'min'</span>), <span class="number">10</span>);</code></pre>
<p>This has been <a href="http://benalman.com/news/2012/05/multiple-var-statements-javascript/">debated at length</a> and is controversial, however we believe this is a better practice due to serveral technical reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easier debugging with dubuggers</li>
<li>Easier merges with version control and diff utilities</li>
<li>Most technical issues are resolved by &#39;use strict&#39;</li>
<li></li>
<li>... </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="feature-detection">Feature Detection</h4>
<p>Always test for the existence of a browser API, function, or object property before you use it, and make sure the user experience is still functional (to the extent possible) if it&#39;s not found. We rely on JavaScript-based feature detection rather than server-side device detection because it&#39;s more robust, easily maintained, and future-proof.</p>

<section><h2 id="responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</h2>
<p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) is the term used for the practice of creating page layouts and user experiences that work on a variety of devices and screen sizes.</p>
<p>With the ever expanding mobile landscape and the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), the idea of a &quot;standard&quot; screen size has fallen by the wayside in favor of the rise of a device-agnostic approach. It is less and less common to launch two versions of a site, one for desktop and one for mobile.</p>
<p>To this end a series of techniques have been put together for pages to adjust based off browsers&#39; current specs (e.g. width, height, pixel density, orientation, etc).</p>
<p>The techniques are referred to as Responsive Web Design (RWD) and it is another technique in the toolbox of <em>progressive enhancement</em> and <em>adaptive web design</em>.</p>
<h3 id="goals-of-responsive-web-design">Goals of Responsive Web Design</h3>
<p>The goals of RWD are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer an optimized user experience (UX),</li>
<li>regardless of the user&#39;s screen size or features supported on their device.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is true whether it is a stadium jumbotron or the screen of a watch — and of course everything between.</p>
<p>Despite this lofty ideal, on Web projects the term &quot;responsive web design&quot; has generally been used in reference to an optimized experience for a set of target devices, usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>A particular set of cell (smart) phones,</li>
<li>various tablets,</li>
<li>or desktop computer monitors (depending upon the target audience).</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically reasonable effort is applied to accommodate the ideal UX for devices with screen sizes that fall outside of and in between.</p>
<p>Overall, critical content and features on a site should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjustable to different types of user interaction (e.g. click, swipe, pinch)</li>
<li>Realistically accessible based on the capabilities of different devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>If meeting desktop browsers&#39; feature sets and dealing with different platforms was difficult before, RWD introduces an almost infite ecosystem of hardware and software that Web pages need to work on. The level of effort does often increase on projects featuring RWD.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started-with-rwd">Getting Started with RWD</h3>
<p>As the name of RWD implies, it all starts with a flexible design that features components having mutable characteristics based on the available screen canvas and varied types of user interactions. Careful consideration needs to be taken when innovating to derive a design that can respond to various screens.</p>
<p>For a given project, always consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>The extent of the use cases for each feature on the site.</li>
<li>The target audience and likelihood they may be using an alternative device to conduct certain activities on the site.</li>
<li>If all target devices will support all the technologies required.</li>
<li>That the UX will <strong>not</strong> be 100% the same across all devices, browsers and screens — nor should it be!</li>
<li>What happens to the design when the screen gets smaller and larger than the static canvas size it is being designed on.</li>
<li>For placement of content and decorative elements, are there patterns or rules that can describe where it falls and adjust with screen sizes?</li>
<li>Will some components be better suited as vector graphics (SVG or fonts) instead of raster files to allow for distortion free scaling?</li>
<li>Will assets need to be produced in different formats for different devices (e.g. Flash video vs. HTML5 video, lower resolution artwork vs. high resolution artwork, smaller file sizes vs. larger sizes).</li>
<li>If a device offers a superior UX for some types of interaction (e.g.  native date-pickers vs. traditional browser controls, or swiping instead of clicking on dots).</li>
<li>What happens when a feature is not supported by a device, or if a feature were to fail in a given device?</li>
<li>What if a device went offline during usage of a feature?</li>
<li>The best ways to detect support for various features (e.g. Modernizr, etc.).</li>

<h4 id="to-use-a-prebuilt-grid-or-not-">To Use A Prebuilt Grid Or Not?</h4>
<!-- @todo: content on grid systems -->

<p>Sometimes CSS grid frameworks are a good place to start ... but sometimes not.</p>
<p>They must match the design in terms of flexibility.</p>
<p>It&#39;s critical a developer learn the basics of how grid systems</p>
<p>It may be beneficial to learn the coming Flexbox techniques as well.</p>
<aside class="box">
  <p>While using a Framework isn&#39;t always the way to go, there is much to be learned from examining <a href="https://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/resources.html#frameworks">how they work and how they are put together</a>.</p>

<h4 id="progressive-enhancement">Progressive Enhancement</h4>
<p>Since mobile phones and tablets are frequently the lower end in terms of capabilities, it is recommended to start with building the mobile experience first, and gradually add features. With this in mind, RWD could be considered a type of <a href="https://www.filamentgroup.com/dwpe/">Progressive Enhancement</a>, whereby users with basic devices can access basic content and features, however care is taken to layer on more sophisticated features for more powerful devices and desktop users.</p>
<p>With these techniques, users only get what their device or browser can handle, and feature detection can be used to add more features when appropriate — without breaking on less capable devices.</p>
<h4 id="setting-target-device-requirements">Setting Target Device Requirements</h4>
<p>For a given project, check Web server logs, current industry statistics and trends, and consult with a client on their audience and proposed use cases when determining a baseline set of devices to build the site and test for.</p>
<p>What types of users are there? Is an audience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working on their commute from a bus or train?</li>
<li>Paying bills or their taxes on the go?</li>
<li>Accessinging financial information with their clients on the go, over lunch?</li>
<li>Entering sales figures remotely?</li>
<li>Enjoying witty content or editorials?</li>
<li>Comfortably browsing for fun at home?</li>
</ul>
<p>It is near impossible to test on every version of every platform, particularly with something like Android where fragmentation of the feature set is totally unpredictable. Comparison of platforms and statistics regarding particular releases of particular versions of an operating system may need to be considered.</p>

<h3 id="general-responsive-design-standards">General Responsive Design Standards</h3>
<p>RWD is frequently said to be achieved through the use of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Percentage-based grids, </li>
<li>flexible images that scale, </li>
<li>and <strong>CSS media queries</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p>These are the core ideas behind RWD, though other techniques are often employed as the term grows in popularity and the use cases evolve. </p>
<p>Like all programming and creative processes there is flexibility in how you go about achieving these, so long as there is consistency within your team. </p>
<p>Some core guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always design and develop the <strong>mobile UX first</strong> (thus start with small defaults and scale upwards; please see Mobile First)</li>
<li>Set the <strong>baseline Media Queries as a team</strong> for various types of devices, and try to stick to them as much as possible. </li>
<li><strong>Add additional Media Queries</strong> — <strong>as necessary</strong> — for less than ideal experiences at the sizes in between, as appropriate for different types of content and components.</li>
<li><strong>Build for speed</strong> (load time and interaction) and the minimum viable product for slower connection speeds and less able devices.</li>
<li>Be careful of <strong>images</strong>. Do not render a 5GB image at 100px by 100px. This does not change the bandwidth needed to download the file! Similarly if you are hiding an image with <code>display: none</code>, <code>visiblity: hidden</code> or similar, the image may still be downloaded.</li>
<li>Test on <strong>real hardware</strong>. Actual testing on <em>actual devices</em> cannot be substituted with resizing a browser window, or even an &quot;emulation&quot; mode offered by a desktop browser.</li>
<li>A <strong>mobile browser</strong> is not a small desktop browser. Mobile versions of desktop browsers are frequently woefully different (or a totally different product) than their desktop counterparts, so do not assume that just because it works on Chrome desktop that it will work on an Android device.</li>
</ul>
<p>Initial work, and first pass tests of media queries, may be performed in desktop browsers by resizing the screen or using a browser&#39;s developer tools that may feature an emulation mode (e.g. Chrome DevTools).</p>
<p>However, this is <em>never a substition</em> for actual testing on actual devices with various Operating System versions and </p>

<h4 id="media-queries-and-css-breakpoints">Media Queries and CSS Breakpoints</h4>
<p>Added as part of the CSS3 specification, <strong>media queries</strong> consist of a media type and at least one expression of a media feature (such as height, width and orientation) that describe the conditions under which a set of CSS rules apply. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css"><span class="at_rule">@<span class="keyword">media</span> screen (min-width: <span class="number">300</span>px) and (max-width: <span class="number">800</span>px) </span>{
  <span class="class">.some-selector</span><span class="rules">{
    <span class="comment">/* CSS declarations go here */</span>
  <span class="rule">}</span></span>
}</code></pre>
<p>These widths are referred to as <em>breakpoints</em> as they are the point at which layout behavior breaks with the design at the prior size. This is typically screen size, and sometimes other conditions such as pixel density or even screen orientation (e.g. landscape or portrait; although this isn&#39;t that useful).</p>
<p>These are applied with CSS Media Queries test the device or browsers current feature set for various conditions and feature support. The most common example is screen size.</p>
<p>The golden rule is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t specify vendor- or device-specific widths</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Let the content and the design dictate the breakpoints.</p>
<ul>
<li>For instance, targeting an ipad in portrait or an ipad landscape.</li>
<li>Popular devices will come and go and even within devices the specifications will change over time. </li>
<li>Avoid orientation/resolution based specifications in favor of width based ones (remember you are <strong>not</strong> targeting devices!). </li>
</ul>
<aside class="box">
  <p><a href="https://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/resources.html#media-queries">Media Query Resources</a></p>
  <p><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/03/device-agnostic-approach-to-responsive-web-design/">A Device Agnostic Approach to Responsive Web Design</a> is a great read on responsive techniques that do not favor one device over another, and are driven by content elements.</p>
</aside>

<p>If you are placing breakpoints every 50-100px you are doing something wrong. While there is not a correct number of breakpoints there must be a balance between the control of the design and a manageable code base.</p>
<p>While working with media queries here are a few things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>All modern browsers support CSS3 Media Queries (including browsers as far back as the stock Android 2.1 browser)</li>
<li>IE8 and below do not support Media Queries.<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond">Respond.js</a> (and similar JavaScript libraries) can be used to enable support for Media Queries in these older browsers (if needed).</li>
<li>Attempting to ployfill Media Query behavior in older browsers is usually not advisable. This is because the JS needed will cause an additional performace hit to the already slow Javascript and rendering engine. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, you are better off forcing older browsers to experience the site through a desktop experience (optionally tailored specifically for these older browsers).</p>
<ul>
<li>This can be done either through feature detection (with the likes of Modernizr) or with IE conditional statements and optionally including additional CSS stylesheets.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mobile-first">Mobile First</h4>
<p>The &quot;Mobile First&quot; techniques consider the lowest common denominator first, which is likely to be your mobile devices due to bandwidth limitations, loading times (not just screen size!), and even CPU speed of the devices.</p>
<p>Key considerations and techniques include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting small, and work upwards. Use <code>min-width</code>, <strong>not</strong> <code>max-width</code> breakpoint definitions). </li>
<li>Begin with global content styles that apply across all breakpoints.</li>
<li>Next, add the styles that are seen below the smallest break point -- remember that using the <code>min-width</code> approach means that the &quot;first breakpoint&quot; will not be for small screens (like mobile size screens) but rather for larger ones (like mobile landscape or phablet size screens).</li>
<li>From here add additional styles at successive breakpoints using <code>min-width</code> media queries leveraging the CSS cascade to progressively add additional styles.</li>
<li>As the queries increase in minimum sizes, add the markup and styles necessary to lay components out differently on larger screens.</li>
<li>Examine site features for mobile-specific JavaScript events (e.g. touch, pointer, vs. mouse) and interactions (e.g. swipe).</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally speaking smaller screen designs are a bit less complex (fewer images, effects, etc). Thus as the screens get larger the complexity tends to increase, conveniently lending to an additive approach to styling, very much in line with a mobile first pattern. </p>
<p>An example of working upwards in a CSS file might be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">/* GENERAL STYLES */
.example {...}

/* SECTION SPECIFIC STYLES - aimed at the smallest devices*/
.hero {...}

@media(min-width: 600px) {
  .hero {
    /* just the new stuff here, no need to be repetitive... */   
  }  
}

@media(min-width: 800px) {
  .hero {
    /* just the new stuff here, no need to be repetitive... */   
  }  
}

@media(min-width: 1400px) {
  .hero {
    /* might need larger font sizes at largest screen sizes */   
  }  
}</code></pre>
<aside class="box">
  <p>Note: the breakpoints specified above are <strong>not</strong> intended to be recommended breakpoints, but rather just illustrative of this general concept.</p>
</aside>

<p>Another way of thinking about a mobile first pattern (from a design and development standpoint) is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Innovate for your smallest reasonable target device.</li>
<li>Then start &quot;sizing your window up&quot; until the user experience or the design degrades.</li>
<li>Add in a breakpoint and make some design modifications to fix the degradation.</li>
<li>Resume sizing up your view port until you reach a similar breakdown in design and repeat this exercise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recurse on this until you reach your largest reasonable target device - this is the mobile first pattern. </p>
<h4 id="speed-is-a-feature">Speed is a feature</h4>
<p>People expect page load time to be as fast if not faster on their mobile phones in comparison to a desktop experience. </p>
<ul>
<li>Try to keep your website&#39;s foot print as small as possible (this is a general best practice).</li>
<li>Start with global styles that apply across all breakpoints<ul>
<li>Optionally in-line these vital styles for faster initial render time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consider every HTTP request<ul>
<li>The request itself may end up taking as much if not more time then the transfer of the data and could block downstream actions or more vital downloads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Concatenate, gzip and minified your production CSS/JS where possible as this will lower page load size and time.2</li>
<li>Load the least amount of JavaScript that is needed.<ul>
<li>Wherever possible include script files at the end of your HTML document just before the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Advanced CSS3 techniques are easy to implement, but when you start combining them, rendering and scrolling performance can be affected.</p>
<p>Be careful of images! </p>
<ul>
<li>Use a responsive image pattern that starts by serving a mobile optimized (and thus smaller file size) image first.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="responsive-images">Responsive Images</h4>
<p>Currently there is little to no native support for responsive images. </p>
<p>The proposal with the most traction appears to be the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element and related <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> attributes. </p>
<aside class="box">
  <p>You can read about this element and the evolution and standard at <a href="http://responsiveimages.org/">ResponsiveImages.org</a></p>
  <p>At this time the best application of the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> is with the <a href="https://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/">Picturefill polyfill</a>.</p>
</aside>

<p>It can be cumbersome to set up, so take care and be certain the benefits are worth it on a given site.</p>
<p>Some basic rules to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Always</strong> optimize your images using a tool such as Adobe Photoshop to assure you have the ideal image size and right amount of lossy compression. </li>
<li>Run all images though a lossless compressor like <a href="https://compressor.io/">Compressor.io</a>, <a href="https://smush.it">Smush.it</a> or <a href="https://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a> (which has related tools also available as build-time scripts).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also consider “Compressive Images”, which are basically higher-resolution jpegs compressed at a higher percentage rate:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://filamentgroup.com/lab/rwd_img_compression/">Compressive Images</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.netvlies.nl/design-interactie/retina-revolution/">Retina Revolution</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/compressive-image-tests/">Compressive Image Tests</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The browser tends to use significantly more memory when storing and resizing these higher resolution images than scaling them to fit a container</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s important to realize is that this is changing faster than we can develop. What you do now will be obsolete very soon, so be sure to stay on top of current trends.</p>
<h4 id="vector-graphics-svg-">Vector Graphics (SVG)</h4>
<p>When working with an audience on unknown screen sizes and resolutions, as is the pretense in RWD, having graphics that can scale without degrading is a very appealing prospect. There are several vector implementation options.  </p>
<p>Web fonts: Fonts are vectors. With the exposure of custom web fonts as part of the CSS level 2 specification, many developers have turned to custom font packages as a solution for icons and simple vectors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: this option allows for easy control of vector color, size and usage</li>
<li>Cons: all of the vectors single color and must be grouped others in one file.</li>
</ul>
<p>SVG: SVG is an XML syntax for describing vector shapes. </p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: vectors can be manipulated by CSS and/or JavaScript and allows for complex filters, animations and transitions.</li>
<li>Cons: SVG is only supported by IE9+</li>
</ul>
<aside class="box"><p><a href="http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/grumpicon-workflow.html">Grumpicon</a> is a script that will detect SVG support and server the appropriate CSS (or needed fallback CSS code to assure compatibility.</p>

<h4 id="other-categories">Other Categories</h4>
<p>Virtually everything can change when screen sizes change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grids</li>
<li>Typography</li>
<li>Accessible forms / validation messages</li>
<li>Main site navigation</li>
<li>Header or Footer content</li>

##### Responsive Data Tables

Displaying data tables in a responsive way on Mobile sites is a challenge. There are only so many good ways to address this.

 - Simply make a wrapper around the table and scroll horizontally.
 - Have CSS rules which collapse the tables.
 - Sometimes JavaScript might be used to hide/show certain less critical columns, however this does add overhead.
