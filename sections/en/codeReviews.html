		<h1>Code Reviews</h1>
		
		<p>A code review is the cornerstone of the formal process for ensuring the quality of user experiences developed by the Creative Technology team. This involves a meeting among authors of markup, reviewers and other stakeholders, with expected input and subsequent code revisions. Simply put, we encourage conducting code reviews to keep our tools sharp and clean.</p>

	<strong>Why should I have a code review?</strong>
	<p>Code reviews are a strategic investment of time to mitigate risk on a project.</p>
	
	<p>Often times, interface developers are asked to author markup from wire frames or visual compositions. However, its possible that screens that are designed cannot be translated to markup easily, or without compromising quality. Code reviews provide an opportunity for this risk to be addressed and resolved before full production of pages begins.</p>
	
	
	<strong>Code reviews increase the overall level of knowledge across projects</strong>
	<p>Since code reviews involve members from within and outside a project team, techniques and best practices are easily shared throughout the entire Creative Technology team.</p>
	
	
	<strong>Code reviews eliminate bugs before they are reproduced from a few templates into multiple pages</strong>
	<p>Ideally, code reviews are conducted early in the development process, before full production of pages begins. When templates are reviewed by the team and run through multiple validation tools and browsers, bugs can and will appear. This is the ideal time for bugs to be fixed.</p>
	
	
	<strong>Code reviews give a set of fresh eyes an opportunity to spot issues with code</strong>
	<p>Reviewers from outside a project team can spot issues with code more easily than authors of markup, who have been working with code for a longer amount of time.</p>
	
	
	<strong>Who should participate in a code review?</strong>
	<p>Ultimately, the front end engineering  Lead on a project is required to ensure that proper code review procedures are followed.</p>
	
	<p>Ideally, a practice lead should act as facilitator for a code review session, unless the practice lead is also the interface developer whose code is under review. In this situation, a project manager can be brought in as a facilitator.</p>
	
	<p>The review team should include at least two senior members of the Interface Technology team versed in development and best practices.</p>
	
	
	<strong>What is required for a code review?</strong>
	<p>Before a code review is conducted, templates to be reviewed must be fully developed, validated, and tested against the browsers and platforms required by the project.</p>
	
	<p>A practice lead and/or interface developer must distribute the following 48 hours prior to the date of the code review:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Code for all pages, associated server-side includes, CSS, and JavaScript. These should be fully commented, printed out with line numbers along the left side, and the file/page name in the footer of each printed page.</li>
		<li>Screenshots of each template</li>
		<li>URLs of the templates, if applicable</li>
		<li>A list of browsers and platforms supported by the project</li>
		<li>A list of known issues/areas of concern</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>It is typical for code to be changed constantly until the code review is to take place. Unfortunately, this does not leave enough time for validation and testing. If this is the case, it is recommended that the code review be rescheduled to a date that ensures a proper code review.</p>
	
	<p>In addition, a practice lead and/or interface developer should book a conference room and call-in number for all attendees, since it is possible that members of either the project or code review team are off-site. An hour should provide enough time for review of two or three templates; however, time will vary depending on the volume and complexity of the templates.</p>
	
	<p>During the code review, a practice lead and/or interface developer should facilitate the meeting, while the practice lead or project manager takes notes and assigns action items. Reviewers should have reviewed the code and come prepared to ask questions or provide feedback.</p>
	
	<p>Notes and action items (including owners) should be distributed to all attendees after the code review. If substantial changes come out of a code review, or all code is not reviewed, it may be necessary to schedule a second code review. However, this should be discussed amongst the project team to determine feasibility.</p>
