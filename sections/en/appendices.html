	<h3>Code Editors</h3>
	
	<p>A great code editor can spark productivity in exceptional ways. Many developers prefer rudimentary text editors, while others prefer powerful integrated development environments (IDEs). What follows is a general listing of some of the more well-known tools; it would be impossible to list them all.</p>
	
	<dl>
		<dt>Aptana</dt>
		<dd>
			Aptana Studio is a powerful, free and open source Ajax development environment which runs stand-alone or within Eclipse. Aptana Studio offers tooling for Ajax including HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript editing and debugging, plus support via additional free plugins for PHP, Ruby on Rails, Adobe AIR, Apple iPhone development.

		</dd>
		
		<dt>e TextEditor</dt>
		<dd>
			E is a new text editor for Windows, with powerful editing features and quite a few unique abilities. It makes manipulating text fast and easy, and lets you focus on your writing by automating all the manual work. You can extend it in any language, and by supporting TextMate bundles, it allows you to tap into a huge and active community. <a href="http://www.e-texteditor.com/">e TextEditor</a>. [Windows]
		</dd>

		<dt>Edit Plus</dt>
		<dd>

		<dt>Homesite</dt>
		<dd>
			HomeSite 5.5 provides a lean, code-only editor for web development. Advanced coding features enable you to instantly create and modify HTML, CFML, JSP, and XHTML tags, while enhanced productivity tools allow you to validate, reuse, navigate, and format code more easily.

		</dd>
		
		<dt>TextMate</dt>
		<dd>
			TextMate claims to be the "Missing Editor" for Mac OS X. A general purpose editor with a sparse interface, the real power is in it's extensibility. Features column selections, recordable macros, snippets, auto-pairing of brackets and other characters, clipboard history, code folding, tab-triggers, tabbed placeholders and mirror typing. And that's just for starters. Anything that can be done via scripts through the Mac command line can be done through custom commands, allowing an extremely high degree of customization and expansion of the feature set. TextMate's "bundle" format has been adapted by many other code editors including the aforementioned e TextEditor. <a href="http://www.macromates.com">TextMate</a>. [Mac]
		</dd>
