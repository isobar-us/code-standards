		<h1>Search Engine Optimization</h1>		
		
		<p>An essential part of good web design and development is SEO. Well-structured code is the key to ensuring that a web page not only gets properly indexed by search engines, but made accessible to those with limited web capabilities as well.</p>
	</div>

	<h4>Be aware of SEO best practices</h4>

				<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/</a>.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h4>Indexability</h4>

	<p>We must use semantic markup that's readable and logical when JavaScript and CSS are off. All page content must be in HTML; we don't want to use iframes or JavaScript for loading initial indexable content.</p>
	
	<figure class="preCode">All links should be to HTML destinations.</figure>
	<textarea class="brush:html">
		<a href="/shelf/jordan/page/2">
	</textarea> 
	
	<figure class="preCode">Instead of</figure>
	<textarea class="brush:html">
		<a href="javascript:loadPage(2);">
	</textarea>

	<p>This lets the page get indexed correctly by search engines as well as allows users to open in new tabs and windows.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Optimization</h4>
	
	<p>The title tag should feature target keywords for the unique page. The titles should be unique to each page. Headings (h1,h2,etc) should form an outline of the document and represent the most important keywords for that page. URLs should be human-readable with primary target keywords present in them:</p>

	
	<pre>http://domain.com/mens-shoes/basketball/jordan/jordan-mens-ajf-6-basketball-shoe/</pre>	
	<p><strong>vs</strong></p>
	<pre>http:// domain.com/ecomm.cfm?view=prod&prodId=23425</pre>
